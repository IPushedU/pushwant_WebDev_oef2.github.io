            is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting
            that tends to focus on a "combination of lowlife and high tech",
            featuring futuristic technological and scientific achievements, such
            as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with societal
            collapse, dystopia or decay. Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New
            Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers
            like Philip K. Dick, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner,
            J. G. Ballard, Philip Jos√© Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the
            impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while
            avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.
